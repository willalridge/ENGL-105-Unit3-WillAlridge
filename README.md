# ENGL-105-Unit3-WillAlridge

This repository includes instructional files along with sample data for Dr. Gotzler's Fall 2022 ENGL-105 class at the University of North Carolina, Chapel HIll.

It includes a notebook with instructions on how to upload, analyze, and pick out data from the sample data set in Jupyter Lab.

These materials have been adapted from a notebook that I wrote for Dr. Gotzlers class, and a sample data that he provided us with as well.

This data could be used by anyone looking to draw connections between certain aspects of public health within states, counties, or even across the entire United States.

Anyone looking to use this data would be able to pick out specific pieces of data and display them side by side using the instructions in the notebook that within this repository.
